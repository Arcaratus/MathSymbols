# MathSymbols
This is the repository for the Mathematical Symbols and Notation pdf (written in LaTeX).

The pdf is a comprehensive list of general and widely-encountered mathematical symbols and notation that is useful anywhere from middle-school to high-school, maybe even college. The first section provides a quick definition of said symbols. A more comprehensive list of formal and exact definitions is planned in the future. Print the pdf and use it however you like, I'm not the boss of you :P.

# Contributing
If you would like to make a suggestion or change to the pdf, simply create a new [issue](https://github.com/Arcaratus/MathSymbols/issues) with a list of the <i><b>exact</b></i> details and things you'd like to see inside the pdf file.
